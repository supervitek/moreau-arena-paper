## Key Observations

1. **Viper dominates** at 99.9% win rate — HEMOTOXIN passive (stacking DoT on every hit) is extremely powerful with balanced stats, creating unavoidable attrition damage that compounds every tick.

2. **Rhino is the second strongest** at 93.5% — IRON_HIDE passive (flat -2 damage reduction) is very effective against the moderate base damage of balanced builds. Only Viper's DoT stacking can bypass it, and Wolf's sustained damage occasionally breaks through.

3. **Wolf remains the strongest original animal** at 59.6% — Pack Howl and Rend provide sustained damage amplification.

4. **Panther enters as a strong contender** at 57.9% — SHADOW_STALK (guaranteed first crit) provides a significant early advantage.

5. **The original mid-tier** (Bear, Buffalo, Snake, Tiger) remains stable around 50-57%.

6. **Hawk underperforms** at 32.8% — THERMAL_SOAR (+1 movement) provides little combat advantage in the grid system, and Screech Debuff's accuracy reduction is modest.

7. **Rock-paper-scissors dynamics**: Even with 18 animals, clear counter relationships emerge. Viper > Rhino > Everyone Else. Wolf can occasionally beat Rhino (7%) but not Viper (1%).

## Notes

- All builds used identical 5/5/5/5 stat allocations to isolate animal-specific balance
- Balance tuning for Rhino and Viper may be needed before competitive play
- Future tournaments should explore optimized stat distributions per animal
