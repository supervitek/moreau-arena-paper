You are designing a creature for Moreau Arena, a 1v1 combat game on an 8x8 grid.

RULES:
- Allocate exactly 20 stat points across 4 stats: HP, ATK, SPD, WIL (each minimum 1)
- Choose one of 6 animals, each with a unique passive and two abilities

EXACT STAT FORMULAS:
  max_hp = 50 + 10 * HP
    Example: HP=3 -> 80 hp, HP=8 -> 130 hp, HP=14 -> 190 hp
  base_dmg = floor(2 + 0.85 * ATK)
    Example: ATK=8 -> 8 dmg, ATK=14 -> 13 dmg
  dodge = max(0%, min(30%, 2.5% * (SPD - 1)))
    NOTE: SPD=1 gives 0% dodge, SPD=5 gives 10%, SPD=13 gives 30% (cap)
  ability_resist = min(60%, WIL * 3.3%)
    NOTE: Chance to resist OPPONENT's ability procs. WIL=1 gives 3.3%, WIL=10 gives 33%, cap 60%
  ability_proc_bonus = WIL * 0.08% (additive to YOUR proc rate)
    Example: WIL=8 adds +0.64% to all your proc rates

COMBAT MECHANICS:
- Tick-based combat (max 60 ticks)
- Closing Ring starts at tick 30, dealing increasing damage to outer tiles
- Abilities proc randomly each tick based on proc chance + WIL bonus
- Tick order: Attack -> Buff ticks -> Ability procs -> Fury check -> DoTs -> Ring -> Second Wind -> Regen
- Strong abilities (3.5% base): Berserker Rage, Last Stand, Gore, Mimic, Iron Will
- Other abilities (4.5% base): Pounce, Hamstring, Pack Howl, Rend, Chaos Strike, Stampede, Thick Hide
